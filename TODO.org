- Allow working with ports (or other open-ended byte sequences) as an
  alternative to bytevectors.

- See what to do with the "meta" field of descriptors.  Should it be
  part of the public API?  Should it be removed and guile/ffi.scm
  dropped?  Should we move to a different record system that allows
  subtyping and obviates the need for the field?
