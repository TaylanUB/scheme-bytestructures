- Bit-level access ?  (E.g. TCP packets have single-bit flag fields.)
  Possible with (rnrs arithmetic bitwise), but I don't think we will
  ever support bitwise offsets into bytevectors, so descriptors will
  still have to "govern" whole byte-regions.

- A utility that reads C header files and spits out descriptors, in
  either object or source form, probably source.

- When writing a bytevector atop a bytestructure through assignment,
  is it really our job to stop writing at the end of the current
  descriptor's bounds, or should we write all of the given BV?
